            <p>Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</p>
            <p>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Noooooo! Noooooo! That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? <strong> Bender!</strong> <em> Ship!</em> Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!</p>
            <h2>And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it.</h2>
            <p>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</p>
            <ol>
            <li>That's not soon enough!</li><li>That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.</li><li>Kids have names?</li>
